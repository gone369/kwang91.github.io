Dear Hiring Manager,

<br>

When I left my last position, by boss said that any company would be lucky to have me, little did she know, Iâ€™d be back with AT&T. With a passion for media marketing, and the training from a top corporation, I am confident I am a great candidate for the Advertising Sales Coordinator position. 

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, while at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship. I believe these skills and qualities will be an asset to you and your team.

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. Please let me know when would be a good time to further discuss my interest and my potential contribution in this position. Thank you

<br>
Best regards,
Kyle Wang
