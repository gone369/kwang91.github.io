Dear Hiring Manager,

<br>
Having been trained by one of the top companies in the world (AT&T), I set out to create my own company. Having accomplished that, I now look to return home. With a passion for media marketing, and experience from both large and small enterprises, I am confident I am a great candidate for the Advertising Sales Coordinator position. 

When I was last with AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, while working at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship. I believe these skills and qualities will be an asset to you and your team.

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. Please let me know, via phone or email, when would be a good time to further discuss my interest and my potential contributions in this position (ask me about my company!). Thank you


<br>
Best regards,

Kyle Wang
