Dear over-worked hiring manager,  
<span style="color:red;">**WARNING**</span>: This may take about one minute to read.

This letter is to express my interest in the account associate position currently available. 

I'd like to start off by stating that most humans believe they are rational beings; that each of their decisions is based on logical thought. I'm here to show you why that is incorrect. The truth is: through a combination of sounds and images, we can be moved to tears, or prompted into swift decisive action. Logical thought plays a much lesser role than we humans are willing to admit, however, it is exactly that stubborn blindness that makes us susceptible to the power of suggestion. 

A recent JWT work that embodies said power is the 2015 Macy's holiday season Believe campaign, particularly the 3-minute short film “The Wish Writer”. I loved how throughout the film, there was a subtle association with the Macy's red to happy/excited/hopeful feelings; hinting to the audience “Macy's can grant your wish this holiday”. Through the use of non-diegetic music and thematic sound cues the feeling of hope builds up over the film, eventually to a tipping point and finally comes pouring out as the sign "Macy's" is revealed, thus creating a strong psychological link between the feeling of happiness and hope with the "Macy's" Brand. (the hidden smiley faces on the parking meter was a nice touch :) . 

Now I won’t lie and tell you that I was a straight A student or that I am exactly what you are looking for. But what I will tell you is that I have a unique set of skills honed through traveling the world and learning from people from all walks of life. I am highly adaptable and can read a situation fairly quickly and accurately, my unquenchable curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me, and my jovial personality makes me a pleasure to work with.. Given my background as service manager with AT&T, Co-founder & partner of a growing business, and my stint in management consulting, I believe I can be of service to you and your team.

If given the chance, I would love the opportunity to sit down and meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and explore the finer nuances of the power of suggestion. 
Please feel free to contact me via Email or Phone. I sincerely and in all earnest look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,  
Kyle Wang
