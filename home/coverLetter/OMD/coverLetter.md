Dear OMD Hiring Manager, 

<br>

Combining insights gained through doing service management with AT&T and project planning with People Momentum Management Consulting, I am looking to make the transition into my true passion: marketing strategy.  I believe I would be a great fit for the Assistant Strategist position currently available. 

I see OMD, being the most innovative and global reaching agency, as the perfect place to start a marketing career. I bring to the table a proven track record of successful client relations management, cross-departmental coordination, and in-depth market research capabilities. I want to help create projects such as the “rental bike” campaign OMD did for Visa last year, which was truly awe inspiring, reaching over 100 million intended audience, and generating over 40% increase in outbound transactions for Visa! 

No work is above me, I am highly motivated and adaptive. Equipped with a growth mindset, my curiosity drives me to learn and absorb from those around me. 

Confident my transferable skills make me an ideal candidate, please find attached my resume for your review. I would also like to request a personal meeting to discuss your goals for this position and my potential contributions. I will be available at your convenience and look forward to your call to arrange a time (please note while I am not local, I am highly mobile, and do not require assistance with relocation), Thank you for your consideration.

<br>

Best Regards,

Kyle Wang
