Dear Hiring Manager,

<br>

I knew I was doing something right after I received my first death threat from a competitor two months into my market expansion campaign for [Bambooroof.com](http://www.bambooroof.com), but more on my “side hustle” later.  Having managed accounts worth over $20 million while exceeding all KPI in my previous position, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the Assistant Account Executive position.

I have a unique set of skills honed through traveling the world and learning from people from all walks of life. I have a growth mindset and am highly adaptable, my unquenchable curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me, on top of that, my jovial personality makes me a pleasure to work with =). Given my background as service manager with AT&T, Co-founder & Partner of a growing business, and my stint in Management Consulting, I believe I can be of service to you and your team.

Like any work from the Grey brand, GHG's  asthma management  campaign in Australia took a message and crafted it in such a way that it was just common sense: "if your not doing it properly, its not working properly". Simple, to the point, and effective. From an industry standpoint, GHG's continued interest and commitment to investing in interactive content and data analysis reflects the forward thinking mentality that keeps GHG at the top of its game. It is this kind of agility and foresight that draws me to GHG.

If given the chance, I would love the opportunity to sit down and meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and, if you’ll indulge me, tell you about my “side hustle”. Attached is my resume, please feel free to contact me via Email or Phone.  I sincerely and in all earnest look forward to hearing from you.


<br>

Best Regards,

Kyle Wang
