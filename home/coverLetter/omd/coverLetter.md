Dear OMD Hiring Manager, 

<br>
 
Having worked at a large corporation like AT&T, I know first-hand how a business views and prioritizes the branding and marketing of their products. I believe my skills and insights gained from working on the client-side will enable me to make a successful transition into my true passion: marketing strategy. I am confident I am a great candidate for the Assistant Strategist position.

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship. I believe these skills and qualities are important to any job, particularly in the field of marketing strategy. 

I see OMD as the perfect place to start my marketing career because it is a leader in media and marketing solutions planning. I want to help create projects such as the VISA Rental Bike campaign OMD did last year, I was especially captivated by the campaign because having grown up in Shanghai, I can understand the mentality of the millennials in China. OMD taps into their desire for freedom and exploration; creating an association between VISA and international travel, effectively locking in a new generation of Chinese VISA users. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. Please let me know when would be a good time to further discuss my interest in this position. Thank you

<br>

Best regards,

Kyle Wang
