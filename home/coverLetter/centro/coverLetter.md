Dear Hiring Manager

<br>
Having worked at a large corporation like AT&T, I know first-hand how a business views and prioritizes the branding and marketing of their products. I believe my skills and insights gained from working on the client-side will enable me to make a successful transition into my true passion: media strategy. I am confident I am a great candidate for the Media Associate position.

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship. I believe these skills and qualities are important to any job, particularly in the field of marketing strategy. 

Having helped launched a startup myself, I know first hand how messy tracking digital media can be, all the channels, sites, accounts, messages, responses… Centro’s platform really consolidates and streamlines the entire experience, I feel that any enterprise, regardless of size, can incorporate Centro into their operation. I want to help make that happen.  

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. Please let me know when would be a good time to further discuss my potential contribution and interest in this position (ask me about my startup!). Thank you


<br>
Best regards,

Kyle Wang
