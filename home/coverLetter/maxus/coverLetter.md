Dear Hiring Manager

<br>
Having been trained by one of the top companies in the world, I set out to create my own startup. Having accomplished that now, I look to resume my career at AT&T. With a passion for media marketing, and experience from both large and small enterprise, I am confident I am a great candidate for the Advertising Sales Coordinator position. 

I am ambitious and driven, equipped with a growth mindset, my curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me.    

When I was last with AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, while working at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship. I believe these skills and qualities will an asset to you and your team.

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. Please let me know when would be a good time to further discuss my potential contribution and interest in this position (ask me about my startup!). Thank you


<br>
Best regards,

Kyle Wang
