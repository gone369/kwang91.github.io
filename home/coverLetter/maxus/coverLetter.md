Dear Maxus Hiring Manager,

Having worked at a large corporation like AT&T, I know first-hand how a business views and prioritizes the branding and marketing of their products. I believe my skills and insights gained from working on the client-side will enable me to make a successful transition into my true passion: media marketing. I am confident I am a great candidate for the Assistant Media Planner position.

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was also taught to synthesize bottom line focused actionable items from proprietary data for my clients. I believe these skills and qualities are important and transferable in field of media strategy. 

Maxusâ€™s work is truly inspiring, the way Maxus came up with the Gameday app to overcome the advertising laws in Malaysia for Tiger Beer was innovative and effective. It is exactly this kind of agility and outside the box thinking that draws me to Maxus.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would love to meet with you to further discuss my interest and potential contribution in this position. You can reach me via email or phone (ask me about my startup!) Thank you.

<br>

Best Regards,


Kyle Wang
