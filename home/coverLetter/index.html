              Dear over-worked hiring manager, 
            </p>

            <p>
              <b class="warning-color">WARNING</b>: This may take about one minute to read.
            </p>

            <p>
              This letter is to express my interest in the account associate position currently available. 
            </p>

            <p>
              I'd like to start off by stating that most humans believe they are rational beings; that each of their decisions is based on logical thought. I'm here to show you why that is incorrect. The truth is: through a combination of sounds and images, we can be moved to tears, or prompted into swift decisive action. Logical thought plays a much lesser role than we humans are willing to admit, however, it is exactly that stubborn blindness that makes us susceptible to the power of suggestion. 
            </p>

            <p>
              A recent JWT work that embodies said power is the 2015 Macy's holiday season Believe campaign, particularly the 3-minute short film “The Wish Writer”. I loved how throughout the film, there was a subtle association with the Macy's red to happy/excited/hopeful feelings; hinting to the audience “Macy's can grant your wish this holiday”. Through the use of non-diegetic music and thematic sound cues the feeling of hope builds up over the film, eventually to a tipping point and finally comes pouring out as the sign "Macy's" is revealed, thus creating a strong psychological link between the feeling of happiness and hope with the "Macy's" Brand. (the hidden smiley faces on the parking meter was a nice touch :) . 
            </p>

            <p>
              Now I won’t lie and tell you that I was a straight A student or that I am exactly what you are looking for. But what I will tell you is that I have a unique set of skills honed through traveling the world and learning from people from all walks of life. I am highly adaptable and can read a situation fairly quickly and accurately, my unquenchable curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me, and my jovial personality makes me a pleasure to work with.. Given my background as service manager with AT&T, Co-founder & partner of a growing business, and my stint in management consulting, I believe I can be of service to you and your team.
            </p>

            <p>
              If given the chance, I would love the opportunity to sit down and meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and explore the finer nuances of the power of suggestion. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Please feel free to contact me via Email or Phone. I sincerely and in all earnest look forward to hearing from you.
            </p>


            <p>
              Best Regards,
            </p>
            <p>
