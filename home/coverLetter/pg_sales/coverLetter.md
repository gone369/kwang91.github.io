Dear P&G

<br>
Having successfully developed and managed accounts worth over $20 million as in Service Managment for AT&T, I am looking to transition into a more proactive role in account management,  I believe I am an ideal candidate for P&G’s Sales - Account Management position. 

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, while interning at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was also taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship.

I see the chance to work for P&G as an unparalleled opportunity, P&G has been a part of my life every step of the way, as a young expat growing up overseas, before I knew what a logo was, whenever I saw a product with with the letters “P&G” on the back, I knew it was good. I began to view the letters as a stamp of quality and trust. It is my wish to help more people see the letters P&G the way I see it.

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would love to meet with you to further discuss my interest and potential contribution in this position. You can reach me via email or phone (ask me about my startup!) Thank you.

<br>
Best regards,

Kyle Wang
