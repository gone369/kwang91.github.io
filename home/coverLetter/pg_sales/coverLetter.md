Dear P&G

<br>
Please note: Despite this being an exciting true story fraught with danger and romance, it is also an attempt to obtain an interview for the Consumer & Market Knowledge - Associate Manager position at P&G.       

After a successful year with AT&T where I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals, I left for China to establish my own startup. There, I leveraged my business development skills I gained interning at People Momentum Management Consulting and my curiosity/desire to understanding how people think (always ask why), to create a real estate agency; specifically, for foreign students. 

Through analyzing the data gained by enlisting one of the local agents and creating psychographic identifiers, my partner and I were able to I.D. an entry point to the market. From there, we manage to isolate and secure (exclusive) demand channels, expand our supply network, and ultimately, corner a piece of the market. It is through these experience, I seek to transition into my true passion, consumer marketing. 

I see the chance to work for P&G as an unparalleled opportunity, P&G has been a part of my life every step of the way, as a young expat growing up overseas, before I knew what a logo was, whenever I saw a product with with the letters “P&G” on the back, I knew it was good. I began to view the letters as a stamp of quality and trust. It is my wish to help more people see the letters P&G the way I see it.

I would love to meet with you to further discuss my interest and potential contribution in this position. And If you’d like, tell you about the danger and romance part of my business adventures. Give me a call! Thank you.

Best regards,
