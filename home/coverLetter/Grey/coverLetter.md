Dear Hiring Manager,

<br>

I knew I was doing something right after I received my first death threat from a competitor two months into my market expansion campaign for Bambooroof.com, but more on my “side hustle” later.  Having managed accounts worth over $20 million while exceeding all KPI in my previous position, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the Client Associate position in Chicago.  

I have a unique set of skills honed through traveling the world and learning from people from all walks of life. I have a growth mindset and am highly adaptable, my unquenchable curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me, on top of that, my jovial personality makes me a pleasure to work with =). Given my background as service manager with AT&T, Co-founder & Partner of a growing business, and my stint in management consulting, I believe I can be of service to you and your team.  

Even though it might be a bit of a taboo, I’ll still say it: I am a huge fan of the work Landor did for BP. The total rebranding and identity overhaul portrayed BP in an eco-friendly light incomparable to any other competitor in the industry. PR nightmare aside, it is exactly work like this, and the restructuring of Taj brand hotels for Tata, that makes me want to be a part of Landor.  

If given the chance, I would love the opportunity to sit down and meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and, if you’ll indulge me, tell you about my “side hustle”. Attached is my resume, please feel free to contact me via Email or Phone.  I sincerely and in all earnest look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,  

Kyle Wang
