Dear Hiring Manager

After a successful year with AT&T where I managed client relations and coordinated cross departmental functions, I left for China to establish my own startup. There, I leveraged the business development skills I gained from interning at People Momentum Management Consulting to develope a real estate agency catering to foreign students. With these accomplishments in mind, I believe I am a ideal candidate for the Nestle Sales Development Program.

During my time at AT&T, I learned to be highly adaptive to the needs of my clients while maintaining and exceeding internal business goals. I learned about the importance of teamwork, and how my curiosity can translate into personal and professional growth. Additionally, at People Momentum Management Consulting, I was also taught how to sell ideas to clients in such a way that appeals to them and ultimately results in a long-lasting business relationship.

I see the chance to work for Nestle as an unparalleled opportunity, Nestle has been a part of my life every step of the way. As a young expat growing up overseas, whenever I saw a product with the the picture a family of birds in a nest, I knew that the product was safe, and delicious. Overtime, I began to view the logo as a stamp of quality and trust. It is my wish to help more people see the Nestle logo the way I see it.   

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications. I would love to meet with you to further discuss my interest and potential contribution in this position. You can reach me via email or phone (ask me about my startup!) Thank you.

Best regards,

Kyle Wang
