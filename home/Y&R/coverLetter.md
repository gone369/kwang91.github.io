Dear Y&R Hiring Manager,

<br>

I knew I was doing something right after I received my first death threat from a competitor two months into my market expansion campaign for Bambooroof.com, but more on my “side hustle” later.  Having managed accounts worth over $20 million while exceeding all KPI in my previous position, I believe I am an ideal candidate for the Assistant Account Executive position.

I have a unique set of skills honed through traveling the world and learning from people from all walks of life. I have a growth mindset and am highly adaptable, my unquenchable curiosity drives me to learn and absorb everything around me, on top of that, my jovial personality makes me a pleasure to work with =). Given my background as service manager with AT&T, Co-founder & Partner of a growing business, and my stint in Management Consulting, I believe I can be of service to you and your team.

After watching a man steal a LG OLED tv on reddit I couldn't believe my eyes, some time researching later, it turned out to be one of Y&R’s brilliant work. Ads like this and the “McWhopper” campaign are are just some of the viral work that is truly inspiring. As they say: “let go to gain control”. These guided user generated content will be a major component of reaching the new generation, and as a digital native, I am here to help. 

If given the chance, I would love the opportunity to sit down and meet with you to further discuss my qualifications and, if you’ll indulge me, tell you about my “side hustle”. Attached is my resume, please feel free to contact me via Email or Phone.  I sincerely and in all earnest look forward to hearing from you.


<br>

Best Regards,


Kyle Wang
